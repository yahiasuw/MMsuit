# Component Specifications

## 1 **System Requirements**
- Python 3.8+
- Required Libraries:
  - **Dash**: For building the web application interface.
  - **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations and plotting.
  - **Pandas**: For handling data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations and calculations.
  - **SciPy**: For optimization routines, particularly to fit data to the Michaelis-Menten equation.
  
## 2 **Architecture**
- **Frontend (Dash)**: The frontend will be a Dash app, providing a responsive, interactive web interface.
  - User input components are dropdown menus and file uploaders.
  - Interactive plots embedded using Plotlyâ€™s charting library.
  
- **Backend**:
  - The backend will be responsible for processing the uploaded data, performing kinetic calculations, and simulating enzyme kinetics. This will be implemented using Python.
  - Data storage will be transient, with results held in memory until the user opts to export them.

## 3 **Kinetic Calculation Details**
- **Michaelis-Menten Equation**: The basic form of the equation is:

  $V = \frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}$
  Where:
  - $V$ = reaction velocity
  - $[S]$ = substrate concentration
  - $K_m$ = Michaelis constant
  - $V_{max}$ = maximum reaction velocity
  
- **Lineweaver-Burk Plot**: A linearized form of the Michaelis-Menten equation, given by:
  
  $\frac{1}{V} = \frac{K_m}{V_{max}} \cdot \frac{1}{[S]} + \frac{1}{V_{max}}$

- **Eadie-Hofstee Plot**: An alternative linearization of the Michaelis-Menten equation:

  $V = V_{max} - K_m \cdot \frac{V}{[S]}$

- **Additional Calculations**:
  - $k_{cat} = \frac{V_{max}}{[E]_{\text{total}}}$
  - $t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k}$, where $k$ is the rate constant.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The application should handle datasets with up to 10,000 data points without performance degradation.
- **Usability**: The interface should be simple, intuitive, and responsive. It should provide visual feedback on successful calculations and simulations.
- **Compatibility**: The application should be browser-compatible and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Security**: The application will use HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission.

## 5. Conclusion
MMsuit will serve as a powerful, interactive tool for researchers and educators in the field of biochemistry and biophysics. By combining easy-to-use functionality with powerful analytical capabilities, it will help users interpret enzyme kinetics data, simulate reaction dynamics, and visualize the results in a variety of useful formats.

## 6. Timeline *{5 days each}*
- **Backend developement**: Successfully computing different constants and ploting graphs
- **Frontend development**: Transfering functions to dash framework
- **Testing**: building tests for the application
